## 1. Executive Summary & Core Philosophy

**SkillFlex** is a soft-skills training and placement-readiness mentorship platform built primarily for engineering and professional college students in India. 

### The Core Problem
Students graduating from Tier-2 and Tier-3 institutions often possess strong technical knowledge but face high rejection rates in campus recruitment due to communication bottlenecks:
- Fear of speaking during self-introductions and group discussions (GDs).
- Hesitation switching from mother tongues (Marathi, Hindi) to fluent professional English.
- Automated AI-based speech/video scoring tools that penalize vernacular accents, misinterpret cultural colloquialisms, and offer vague, un-actionable scores without explaining *how* to improve.
- Institutional placement cells that lack the mentor-to-student bandwidth to give personal feedback to hundreds of students every week.

### The Foundational Guarantee: "Assessed by People, Not by AI"
SkillFlex enforces an absolute product promise:
- **No artificial intelligence evaluates, grades, or assigns scores to a student's speech or video.**
- Every submitted video recording is reviewed by a **vetted human mentor** who writes actionable notes, scores standard rubrics (e.g., Clarity, Active Listening, Contribution), and dictates the exact **Next Action Step**.
- Generative AI is strictly constrained to **reorganizing human instructions** into structured weekly task lists without ever hallucinating evaluation criteria.

---

## 2. Target Audience & Commercial Model

### 2.1. Commercial Model: B2B2C Institutional Licensing
- **Colleges Buy the Seats**: The platform is licensed by institutions (Colleges, Universities, Training & Placement Cells) on an annual per-student subscription model.
- **Zero Cost to Students**: Students access all features, mentors, practice games, and live sessions without personal payments, paywalls, or in-app purchases.
- **Cross-Institutional Mentor Pool**: Mentors do not belong to the student's college. Students can switch mentors without losing their historical progress, recordings, or feedback logs.

### 2.2. Value to Educational Institutions
- **NAAC / NBA Placement Metrics**: Colleges receive aggregate, cohort-level analytics demonstrating student practice hours, skill improvements, and placement readiness.
- **Absolute Student Privacy**: Colleges **never** receive raw video recordings of students practicing, ensuring psychological safety and student willingness to experiment and make mistakes without fear of academic penalty.

2. **Destructive Revocation (Right to Erasure)**:
   - When a student revokes `video_recording` consent, all historical video recordings are immediately marked and scheduled for permanent deletion within 7 days.
   - The student's written notes and grades remain safe, but video files are purged from storage.
3. **Data Portability (Download My Data)**:

## 10. Media Pipeline & Storage Infrastructure

1. **Storage Provider Abstraction**:
   - In Development: Uploads are stored locally in the `/storage` directory and served via `@fastify/static`.
   - In Production: Generates presigned `PUT` URLs to private S3 / Cloud Storage buckets.
2. **Access Control**:
   - Media URLs are private and signed with time-limited expirations (e.g., 15 minutes).
   - Only the owning student and their assigned mentor can request playback tokens for a submission.
3. **Retention & Auto-Purge Worker**:
   - Background worker checks for submissions marked with `scheduledForDeletion` (triggered by consent revocation).
   - Once the 7-day grace period expires, video blobs are permanently deleted from storage.
